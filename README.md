# Austin_Traffic_Fatalities

For our project we will be analyzing Austin's traffic fatalities over the last six years. We will be examining several factors involved in these traffic fatalities (location time, vehicle types, cause of the accident, soberitity, and seatbelt usage). Our data comes from data.austintexas and we are basing our project on data sets provided from APD traffic reports. Through our data minning and analysis, we hope to produce readable analysis and visualization that will:

- map the specific locations of Austin traffic fatalities 
- determine the most common casue, vehicle type and time of day involved in these accidents 
- compare the total number of these accidents among each year over the six year span our data set provides
- determine the percentage of these accidents occured while the driver was wearing a selt beat and vice versa
 - determine the percentage of these accidents occured while the driver was sober and vice versa
